<h3><u>Recording Demos</u></h3>
<p>The Demos Screen is reached by pressing F6 from the Game Screen.
</p>
<p><b>To record a demo:</b>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>While playing a game, go to the room in which you wish to record
your demo.
  </li>
  <li>Press F5 and type a description.
  </li>
  <li>Your demo is now recording. &nbsp;Perform whatever actions you
want. &nbsp;Dieing, restarting, or exiting the level will automatically
stop recording.
  </li>
  <li>Press F5 when you are finished, to stop recording and save the
demo.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>You can also set DROD to automatically record demos when you conquer
a room or die. &nbsp;After setting the appropriate options from the <a
 href="settings.html">Settings Screen</a>, it is not necessary to
control demo recording. &nbsp;When you have conquered a room or died, a
demo will then be saved.
</p>
<p><b>To watch or delete a demo:</b>

<ol>
  <li>While playing a game, go to the room in which you began recording
your demo.
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>A list of demos recorded in this room, if any, will be displayed
on the left side of the screen. &nbsp;Detailed information for one
selected demo appears on the right. &nbsp;Select the demo you would
like to watch or delete.
  </li>
  <li>Click the "Watch" or "Delete" button, depending on your intent.
While viewing a demo, press Space to pause, Up to speed up demo replay
and Down to slow playback.
  </li>
