<h3>Brains</h3>
<hr>
<p>This ominous blob of neurons is not directly
dangerous because it never moves or attacks. &nbsp;The brain expands
its consciousness to all of the monsters in the room so that it can
communicate with them. &nbsp;When an explorer enters the room, it
alerts all of the monsters and gives them instructions on what paths to
take to get to the intruder.
</p>
<p>Fighting monsters endowed with the brain's
intelligence becomes much harder as simple obstacles can no longer be
used to prevent monsters from finding Beethro. &nbsp;When all brains in
a room are destroyed, the monsters will return to their normal
intelligences.
