<h3><u><b>Game Elements</b></u></h3>
<br>
<img src="images/beethro.jpg"><br>
<b>Beethro</b> is you. &nbsp;He and his sword take up two squares.
&nbsp;Keeping the sword between Beethro and the monsters is the key to
staying alive. &nbsp;For more information about movement, see <a
 href="keyboard.html">Keyboard Commands</a>.
<p><img src="images/monsters.jpg"><br>
The <b>monsters</b> Beethro destroys in a room will come back to life
when you reenter the room if all of them are not destroyed. &nbsp;You
will want to refer to the authoritative <a href="monster.html">Monster
Reference</a> for more information.</p>
<p><img src="images/walls.jpg"><br>
Like <b>walls</b> in the real world, these are obstacles that prevent
movement.</p>
<p><img src="images/crwalls.jpg"><br>
<b>Crumbly walls</b> are ready to fall apart but have to be looked for
as they blend in with solid walls.</p>
<p><img src="images/pits.jpg"><br>
<b>Pits</b> are not particularly dangerous since Beethro is too
experienced an explorer to accidentally fall into them, but be careful
of <b>trapdoors</b> that can leave him shanghaied and monsters that
fly
across pits. &nbsp;Trapdoors fall away to pits after stepped upon once.</p>
<p><img src="images/gdoors.jpg"><br>
<b>Green doors</b> are opened when all of the monsters in a room are
defeated. &nbsp;Once a green door is opened, it will remain open when a
room is left.</p>
<p><img src="images/bdoors.jpg"><br>
<b>Blue doors</b> are opened when all of the monsters in the level are
defeated and all rooms are visited. &nbsp;There are a few exceptions to
these rules which you may encounter. &nbsp;Once a blue door is opened,
it will remain open when a room is left.</p>
<p><img src="images/ydoors.jpg"><br>
<b>Yellow doors</b> are opened and closed by striking <b>orbs</b> with
Beethro's sword. &nbsp;When an orb is hit, bolts of energy will shoot
from it opening, closing, or toggling one or more doors. &nbsp;There
are some very tricky puzzles that are based on these doors.
&nbsp;Unlike green and blue doors, yellow doors return to their
original state when a room is left.</p>
<p><img src="images/rdoors.jpg"><br>
<b>Red doors</b> are opened when all of the trapdoors in a room have
collapsed. &nbsp;Unlike green and blue doors, red doors always close
again when a room is left.</p>
<p><img src="images/stairs.jpg"><br>
Each level has at least one <b>exit</b> which must be found before the
level can be completed.</p>
<p><img src="images/mimic.jpg"><br>
The <b>mimics</b> are unleashed when Beethro drinks a <b>mimic potion</b>.
&nbsp;After Beethro drinks the potion, all activity in the room stops
while you use the movement keys to find a place for a mimic. &nbsp;When
you've reached the desired location, press the wait key ("5") and a
mimic will appear. &nbsp;Mimics are copies of Beethro and they move
exactly as he does. &nbsp;Pushing the mimics against obstacles will
change their position relative to Beethro.</p>
<p><img src="images/invis.jpg"><br>
When Beethro drinks an <b>invisibility potion</b>, he becomes
invisible to monsters. &nbsp;However if he steps within 5 squares of a
monster it will be able to smell him.&nbsp; Picking up another
invisibility potion will make Beethro visible again.</p>
<p><img src="images/scroll.jpg"><br>
<b>Scrolls</b> contain information that may or may not be useful.
&nbsp;Beethro must step on the same square they are in to read them.</p>
<p><img src="images/forcearrow.jpg"><br>
<b>Force arrows</b> prevent movement in the opposite direction they
point. &nbsp;The north-pointing force arrow could be stepped onto from
all directions except northwest, north, and northeast. &nbsp;Once
Beethro steps onto a north-pointing force arrow he can leave in all
directions except southwest, south, and southeast.</p>
<p><img src="images/checkpoint.jpg" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 28px; height: 26px;"><br>
You can step on <span style="font-weight: bold;">checkpoints</span> to
save game at that point in time in the room. &nbsp;Using checkpoints
can make difficult rooms easier to conquer. &nbsp;If Beethro dies after
stepping on a checkpoint in the room, he will return to the last
checkpoint he stepped on instead of starting the room over. &nbsp;A
checkpoint may be used to re-save game when stepped on any number of
times. &nbsp;Checkpoints can be turned on or off in the <a
 href="settings.html">player settings</a>.</p>
<p><img src="images/map.jpg"><br>
The <b>map</b> shows the rooms in Beethro's immediate vicinity that
have been explored. &nbsp;If a room has any monsters remaining it will
be red.&nbsp; Once all of the monsters have been removed
from the current room it will turn green.&nbsp; When Beethro has exited
a green room successfully it will turn white.&nbsp; Usually, all rooms
must be turned white for Beethro to exit the level.<br>
