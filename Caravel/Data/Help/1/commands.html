<h3><u>Main Menu Commands</u></h3>
<p>This is a summary of the commands shown on the main menu that appear
when DROD first loads: </p>
<p><b>Settings</b> - Takes you to the <a href="settings.html">Settings
Screen</a>, where you can fiddle with things. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who</span> - Takes you to the <a
 href="playerselect.html">Player Selection Screen</a>, where you can
manage one or more player records.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Where</span> -Takes you to the <a
 href="holdselect.html">Hold Selection Screen</a>, where you can select
which levels to play.</p>
<p><b>Continue</b> - Continues from the level and room you were at when
you last exited DROD. &nbsp;If you have never played the selected hold,
this starts a new game from the first level. </p>
<p><b>Restore</b> - Takes you to the <a href="restore.html">Restore
Screen</a>, where you can restore a previously saved game. &nbsp;Note
that you can use the "Continue" command instead, but "Restore" is
useful
for returning to any room or level you have ever visited.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Edit - </b>Takes you to the <a href="editselect.html">level
editor</a>, where you can design your own dungeons for anyone to play.</p>
<p><b>Demo</b> - Watch a pre-recorded game demo. &nbsp;Note that demos
you record are only accessible from the <a href="demos.html">Demos
Screen</a>. </p>
<p><b>Help</b> - If you are reading this, then you've mastered the help
command. &nbsp;One caveat: if you are in fullscreen mode and go to
help,
it will change your screen mode back to normal (windowed). &nbsp;When
you are done reading help, you can press F10 to return to fullscreen
mode. &nbsp;For now, this is a necessary inconvenience. </p>
<p><b>Exit</b> - You should spend all of your time playing DROD and
should never have to exit the game so this command is irrelevant. </p>
