<h3><u>Quick Start &amp; Keyboard Commands</u></h3>
<p>These instructions are for people who don't like to read
instructions. &nbsp;Here's what you do:
</p>
<p>1. Destroy all of the monsters in all of the rooms.
<br>
2. Find the staircase that exits the level.
</p>
<p>Monsters move only after you move. &nbsp;Have patience--this game is
played quite differently from others and takes some getting used to.
</p>
<p>You can wait as long as you want before moving. &nbsp;The monsters
in the room will move immediately after you move. &nbsp;For effective
maneuvering remember that monsters do not move simultaneously with your
movements but right afterward instead, so you may step onto a
vulnerable square as long as you destroy the threatening monster with
that movement.
</p>
