<h3>Roach Queens</h3>
<hr><br>
The Roach Queen will never attack you directly. &nbsp;In fact she'll do
her best to evade you so that she can concern herself with bearing
deadly roach offspring. &nbsp;Every thirty turns she lays eggs in all
empty adjacent squares. &nbsp;The eggs will hatch to full-grown dungeon
roaches after just three turns, so watch out!
<p>It is useful in some situations to know that an egg
cannot be laid in a square that Beethro is standing in.</p>
