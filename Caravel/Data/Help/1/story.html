<h3><u><b>The Story</b></u></h3><p>

Beethro Budkin strolled into the Grand Dining Chamber where King Dugan was finishing his massive morning meal.<p>

"Away, foul commoner! &nbsp;You disrupt my digestion with your poor hygiene!" bellowed the King, with bits of pork and potatoes erupting from his mouth.<p>

"But sir," protested Beethro, "you sent for me."<p>

The expression on the King's large face changed from anger to confusion to recognition to geniality in the space of two seconds.<p>

"I really should have had you come in sooner," said King Dugan. &nbsp;"It's unbelievable! &nbsp;You let your guards eat their meals down in the dungeon, they spread crumbs all over the place, and all of a sudden the place is just swarming with cockroaches, not to mention goblins, serpents, evil eyes, and other nasty things. &nbsp;It's really gotten out of hand."<p>

Beethro straightened with pride. &nbsp;"Not to fear. &nbsp;I am a trained professional from a long line of dungeon exterminators. &nbsp;I combine five generations of passed-down knowledge with the most state-of-the-art equipment to offer efficient extermination service at an affordable price."<p>

"What kind of equipment do you use?"<p>

"I've got a really big sword."<p>

"Good! &nbsp;When can you start?"<p>

"As soon as we handle the details of payment. &nbsp;Here are my standard extermination fees. &nbsp;Just sign at the bottom." &nbsp;Beethro handed a contract to the King.<p>

"These prices are outrageous! &nbsp;Is the privilege of honorable service to the Crown worth nothing these days?"<p>

"I can leave."<p>

"No, no, no. &nbsp;We need that dungeon cleared so that the prisoners can receive their torture in a clean and safe environment."<p>

"Well, I'll give you a discount if you'll throw in a princess."<p>

"You're ugly and you smell bad. &nbsp;None of my daughters will have you!"<p>

Beethro shrugged. &nbsp;"Fair enough."<p>

The King signed at the bottom of the contract. &nbsp;"Right then. &nbsp;Let me show you to the entrance."<p>

With an accompaniment of ten soldiers, Beethro made his way to a large, metal door, covered from top to bottom with locks, bolts, and chains. &nbsp;He unlocked and opened the door with a ring of keys handed to him. &nbsp;The soldiers shrunk back, swords drawn, as the door creaked open to reveal a descending staircase. &nbsp;Far down below, he could see oily, black cockroaches skittering about. &nbsp;"Those cockroaches are as big as I am!" he exclaimed.<p>

"Just get down there!" said the King and some of the soldiers forcefully helped Beethro through the doorway. &nbsp;The door slammed shut behind him and the locks were rapidly put back on. &nbsp;He heard a muffled yell from the other side.<p>

"Don't come back until you're done!"<p>
