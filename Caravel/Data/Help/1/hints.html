<h3><u><b>Hints &amp; Tips: The Wisdom of Gunthro Budkin</b></u></h3>
These writings of the great dungeon exterminator, Gunthro Budkin, were
discovered scratched in a wall next to his corpse in the lower levels
of Korvak's Keep. &nbsp;Judging by nearby carcasses, Gunthro was
cornered by two tenacious goblins and the three starved together in a
standoff. &nbsp;Fortunate we are that the master swordsman was able to
record his hard-earned knowledge before his demise.
<p>---<br>
I write words for those who would pursue the honorable profession of
dungeon exterminator.</p>
<p>When roaches approach in a line, assess the width of
their progression:<br>
If it is but one roach wide, advance with confidence.<br>
If it is two roaches wide, hold your ground.<br>
If it is three roaches wide, a retreat will be necessary.</p>
<p>A sword may be wielded against enemies in two ways.
&nbsp;You may prefer swinging or stepping, but mastery of both is
necessary.</p>
<p>There is no defense against enemies that approach
from more than one direction.</p>
<p>Only an efficient swordsman will prevail against the
roach queen. &nbsp;Move swiftly to the queen, paying as little
attention to her offspring as safety permits.</p>
<p>Fools forget that they can move in eight directions.</p>
<p>Strike an orb repeatedly if you wish to know what
doors it affects. &nbsp;Orbs are entirely predictable and simple to
understand. &nbsp;I have never encountered an orb in Dugan's Dungeon
that affected more than four doors, and I have never found any to
contain complex instructions.</p>
<p>Fear not the most devilish hordes when you stand upon
the force arrows correctly.</p>
<p>Evil eyes would rather sleep, so let them.</p>
<p>The fleet-footed may move easily among a nest of
serpents. &nbsp;They cannot move in the same ways you can, and their
predatory eyes will not find you well if you do not stand in their view.</p>
<p>Don't stir the tar if you needn't. &nbsp;Incaution
has been the death of many.</p>
<p>When approaching the tar mother, find a safe position
before she grows.</p>
<p>Tar that grows in a corridor two squares wide may
become impassable.</p>
<p>I fear no single goblin. &nbsp;Two goblins are
another matter.</p>
<p>Goblins in open spaces can be manipulated favorably
by simply swinging your sword as you stand in place.</p>
<p>Some stairways lead to unexpected places.</p>
<p>There is but one room that the 'Neather can be killed
in. &nbsp;You will have to play his games before you get there.</p>
