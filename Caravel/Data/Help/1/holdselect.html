<h3><u><b>Hold Selection Screen</b></u></h3>
The Hold Selection screen is reached by choosing "Where" from the <a
 href="commands.html">Main Menu</a>. &nbsp;This screen shows a list of
all the loaded holds.  Holds beaten by the current player are marked
with a (*). &nbsp;The following options are available:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Select
hold </span>- select a hold to play by highlighting it and pressing
OK.&nbsp; Pressing Cancel will leave the selected hold unchanged.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete hold</span> - permanently
removes a hold from this installation of DROD.&nbsp; This will remove
all players' saved games and demos for this hold as well, so make sure
you are serious about doing this.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Export
hold</span> - saves a hold you designed to disk. &nbsp;This option
allows you to share your levels with other players by giving them the
file saved to disk.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Import </span>- loads a DROD data
file from disk. &nbsp;This allows you to load or recover exported holds
and
player data.<br>
