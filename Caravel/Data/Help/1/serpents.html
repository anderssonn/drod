<h3>Serpents</h3>
<hr><br>
Serpents are heavily armored and entirely invulnerable to Beethro's
sword. &nbsp;The only way to destroy a serpent is to lead it into a
dead end. &nbsp;Of course, if Beethro walks into the dead end in order
to lead the serpent, it will be a dead end for him too. &nbsp;A serpent
cannot move diagonally. &nbsp;Unlike other monsters, a serpent will
never walk onto a force arrow even if it is going in its direction.
<p>The serpent will generally move towards Beethro but
not always. &nbsp;This is not random--you will want to understand the
serpent's movement behavior to solve different rooms.</p>
