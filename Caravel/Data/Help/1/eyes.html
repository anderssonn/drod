<h3>Evil Eyes</h3>
<hr>
<p>These odd creatures roam dungeons in groups looking
for a suitable nesting area. &nbsp;When the nesting area is found, they
position themselves in such a way that an explorer entering that area
will fall into their line of sight and wake them from sleep. &nbsp;Once
woke, they rush the explorer, often from several directions at once,
and leap onto his body secreting acids to soften him for digestion.
&nbsp;After the meal, they return to their selected positions and sleep
until someone else approaches.
</p>
<p>The evil eye while in its sleeping state will only be
woke if Beethro steps in a square that is in its direct line of sight.
&nbsp;It is possible at times to sneak up on eyes, but they may be
dispatched with a sword blow when awake too.
