<h3><u>Changing Settings</u></h3>
<p>The Settings Screen can be reached from the <a href="commands.html">Main
Menu</a> by choosing the "Settings" option. &nbsp;The following settings
are available: </p>
<p><b>Personal</b> - Enter your player name here.</p>
<p><b>Graphics and Sound</b> - Click "Use full screen" to toggle between
full screen and windowed mode (640x480). &nbsp;Note that you can also
use the F10 key to do this at any time. &nbsp;Turn sound effects and
background music on or off, and set the volume each is played at.&nbsp;
If your sound effects or music don't work, first try closing other
applications and restarting DROD. &nbsp;If you are still without sound,
try rebooting your computer. </p>
<p><b>Special</b> - Select whether to play with room checkpoints or not,
and whether to save <a href="demos.html">demos</a> at special points in
the game. Checkpoints allow saving at certain locations in the middle
of some rooms.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Editor</span> - When "Save
automatically" is checked, changes you make to a room in the <a
 href="editroom.html">editor</a> are saved on leaving the room.
&nbsp;Turn this option off if you want to be prompted before saving any
room changes. &nbsp;Check "Show item tips" to receive help placing
objects in the room. </p>
<p><b><a href="keyboard.html">Keyboard commands</a></b> - Use to
redefine the game commands to different keys. &nbsp;If you are using a
non-US keyboard or have selected a layout other than Qwerty (i.e.
Dvorak), you may see incorrect key descriptions as you redefine keys.
&nbsp;Despite this, the key redefinitions will probably work once you
begin playing the game. &nbsp;(Sorry. &nbsp;We would like to fix this
problem in a future release.)<br>
</p>
<p>Repeat Rate - Controls keyboard repeat rate during play.
&nbsp;Increasing it will decrease the delay between moves when a key is
held down.<br>
