<h3>Roaches</h3>
<hr><br>
The first thing you need to know is that these are not the same kind of
roaches that camp out underneath your kitchen sink. &nbsp;These are <i>dungeon
roaches</i> that average five feet in length and come equipped with
long, flesh-tearing teeth.
<p>Luckily, they have tiny brains and will simply move
towards Beethro without any regard to his slashing sword. &nbsp;All but
the simplest obstacles will thwart them, so Beethro can maneuver them
to his advantage by forcing them to run into walls.</p>
