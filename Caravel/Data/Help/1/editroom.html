<h3><u>Room Editor</u></h3>
<p>The Room Editor is reached by selecting a room in the <a
 href="editselect.html">Editor screen</a>.&nbsp; You can use it to edit
any room in the game's data file. </p>
<p>The Room Editor displays a view of the selected room as it would be
seen in the game.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Selecting Objects for Placement -</b>A tabbed menu of game
objects is shown on the left side of the screen. &nbsp;The objects in
DROD have been broken down into three categories, also called layers:
(1) room pieces (what
the room is made from, such as walls, doors, pits, etc), (2) room
objects (what goes in a room, such as orbs, scrolls, potions, etc), and
(3) monsters (including tar, and placing the player's starting position
in the level entrance room). &nbsp;Select a tab to display that object
category. &nbsp;Click on an item in the menu to select it for placement.</p>
<p><b>Placing Objects</b> - Left-click on a square in the room to place
the currently selected item there.&nbsp; Items cannot be placed on a
square if something already exists there on the same layer as the
object being placed.&nbsp; To delete placed objects, see "Deleting
Objects" below.&nbsp; When an item can't or shouldn't be placed on a
square, it will be shaded red to indicate the object
won't be placed there. &nbsp;The player's level start position is
placed
in the level's entrance room. &nbsp;Placing it in another room will
make
that the new level entrance room.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Object Orientation</span> -
For certain objects, their orientation is significant (such as force
arrows, monsters, and the player's starting position). Use the "Turn
clockwise" and "Turn counter-clockwise" keys or the mouse wheel to
rotate the way objects will be placed. While holding down the left
mouse button, the orientation of the object being placed can be changed
until the mouse button is released.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Placing Multiple Objects</b> - Dragging the mouse with the left
button down will fill the highlighted region with the selected object
on
all open squares. &nbsp;Some items are commonly placed only one at a
time (such as scrolls or checkpoints). &nbsp;For these items, placing
more than one at a time is disabled.<br>
</p>
<p>To make a duplicate copy of a room region, drag the mouse to
highlight a rectangular area and press &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; while the mouse
button is down to mark the region to be copied.&nbsp; The region marked
for copying stays chosen until a new region is marked or you begin
editing a different room.&nbsp; Press &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; at any time to
copy the marked region.&nbsp; Click on a
square to paste a copy of that region, the clicked square being the
top-left corner.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deleting Objects</span> -
Right-clicking on a square will delete any object on that square from
the currently selected menu layer.&nbsp; Dragging a region with the
right mouse button down will delete all objects of that layer in the
selected area.&nbsp; Objects can also be deleted by selecting the empty
floor tile on the menu for a specific layer and placing it as a normal
object.<br>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Undo/Redo</span> - Press the "Undo"
button or &lt;Ctrl-Z&gt; to undo changes you've made to the room during
this
session (since selecting the room for editing). Press "Redo" or
&lt;Ctrl-Y&gt; to
redo changes that have been undone. Note that undone commands cannot be
redone once you
starting making other changes to the room.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Editor Settings</span> - Enabling
the "Show Errors" checkbox will highlight objects in the room that
have an improper or questionable placement (see Room Errors
below).&nbsp; Uncheck "Save room automatically" on the <a
 href="settings.html">player settings</a> screen if you want the editor
to prompt you before saving any changes you have made to a room.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Choosing a Room from the Map</b> - Click on the level map to
select any room in the selected level.&nbsp; You can also click on an
area adjacent to an existing room to add a new room to the level at
that
location. &nbsp;Hit &lt;Ctrl-X&gt; to cut and &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; to copy
the
current room. &nbsp;Hit &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; to paste the marked room to the
currently selected spot on the map. &nbsp;Hit the &lt;delete&gt; key to
permanently erase a room from the game.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Customizing Objects</span> -
Several
items can be customized to act a certain way. &nbsp;Customizable
objects
are the following:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Orbs.&nbsp; Click on an orb to view which yellow gates it
affects.&nbsp; Lightning bolts will flash from the orb to all gates it
is currently acting on.&nbsp; Gates highlighted green will be opened
when the orb is
struck, gates highlighted orange will be toggled, and gates highlighted
red will be closed. &nbsp;Clicking on a yellow gate while in orb
editing mode
will change the effect the orb has on this gate. &nbsp;Clicking on a
square without an orb or a gate will exit orb editing mode.</li>
  <li>Yellow gates.&nbsp; Click on a yellow gate to view which orbs
affect it.&nbsp; Lightning bolts will flash from the gate to all orbs
acting on it.&nbsp; Clicking on an orb while in door editing more will
change the effect the orb has on the selected gate.&nbsp; The color
coding scheme is the same as for orb customization.&nbsp; Clicking on a
square without an orb or a yellow gate will exit door editing mode.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Stairs.&nbsp; After placing stairs, a dialog box will appear with
a
list
of levels in the hold. &nbsp;Select one of the levels to determine
which level the player will go to from this staircase.&nbsp; Selecting
"End hold" means the player finishes the hold on descending these
stairs.&nbsp; Clicking on the checkbox "Show levels from all holds"
will list levels from all holds to which your player has editing
privileges.&nbsp; Selecting a level from a different hold will take the
player to that level and hold.&nbsp; The destination level can be
changed at any time by clicking on the staircase again.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Serpents. &nbsp;Serpents are placed a piece at a time. &nbsp;Once
you start placing a serpent, click on a room square to mark a turn in
its body.
&nbsp;Continue placing segments by clicking to lay down each new piece
of the serpent.
&nbsp;Pieces that have already been placed can be removed by clicking
on part of the last segment placed.
&nbsp;To finish placing the monster, click twice on the same
spot.&nbsp; Click on any previously placed serpent to modify it.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Room Errors </span>- Errors
highlighted in the room include the following:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Matching room edges. &nbsp;Room edge squares are highlighted blue
if they don't match the squares of an adjacent room. An open square
will
be highlighted if there is an obstacle (or no room) on the other side,
for instance.</li>
  <li>Orbs. &nbsp;Orbs generally affect yellow gates. &nbsp;Orbs that
don't affect any gates are marked orange.</li>
  <li>Gates. &nbsp;Yellow gates that don't have any orbs affecting them
are marked orange. &nbsp;Red gates in a room without trapdoors are
highlighted. &nbsp;Green doors in a room without any monsters are
highlighted.</li>
  <li>Strange placement. &nbsp;If an object is put in a location that
might not allow it to be used correctly, it will be marked red.
Examples
of this are placing scrolls or potions on walls where the player can't
get to them.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Playtesting</span> - You can test
the current room by hitting F5, then clicking on the room position
where you
want to begin play. Playtesting continues until &lt;Escape&gt; is
pressed.<br>
</p>
<p>Misc. Notes - When saving a room, any demos and saved games recorded
in that room might no longer be valid and will be deleted.<br>
