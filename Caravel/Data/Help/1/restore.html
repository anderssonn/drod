<h3><u>Restoring Saved Games</u></h3>

<p>The Restore Screen is reached by choosing "Restore" from the <a href=commands.html>Main Menu</a>.&nbsp; You can restore to any one of several previous save points in the game.&nbsp; Each save point stores information about the current room and level, such as which rooms have been explored and conquered up to this point. &nbsp;Saving is performed automatically as you explore the world of DROD, hence there is no save command.

<p>The Restore Screen has the following options
available:

<p><b>Choose Level</b> - Players can choose to restore to any of the levels
they have visited.&nbsp; Choose one from the level list to select it, or restart from the very beginning of the game by clicking the &quot;Game Start&quot; button.

<p><b>Choose Room</b> - Click on the level map to select any room that's been visited previously.&nbsp; Your journey is saved in each room at the point when the room is first entered.&nbsp; Rooms grayed out on the map are rooms that had not yet been visited when the currently selected room was first entered.&nbsp; Click the &quot;Level Start&quot; button 
to start from the beginning of the level with no rooms explored.

<p><b>Choose Position</b> - The mini-room shows the point from which the room will be restored. &nbsp;Room checkpoints that were touched by the player are represented by &quot;X&quot; buttons.&nbsp; Click on an &quot;X&quot; to restore from the last time this checkpoint was stepped on.&nbsp; By default, the room will be restored at the latest checkpoint used.&nbsp; Click the &quot;Room Start&quot; button to return to the time in your quest when the player entered the room for the first time.

<p>Click the &quot;Restore&quot; button to continue from the selected save point.&nbsp; Note that restoring to a previous save point will return you back to that point in time in the level, with rooms that were explored or conquered after that point being reset to the way they were then.
