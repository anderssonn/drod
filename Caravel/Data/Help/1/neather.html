<h3>The 'Neather</h3>
<hr><br>
The legend goes that a king of past grew tired of his annoying young
son and jokingly suggested that the lad go play in the castle dungeons.
&nbsp;Taking his father seriously, the boy wandered deep into the
dungeon chambers and was never found again. &nbsp;It is said that he
did not perish, but lived the rest of his life in the dungeons by
preference. &nbsp;Becoming a master of his new habitat, he learned all
of the secrets of the underground world and formed alliances with the
monsters that dwelt there. &nbsp;He named himself the 'Neather and
schemed to rise from the dungeons to claim the throne when his powers
were able.
