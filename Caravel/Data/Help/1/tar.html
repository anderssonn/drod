<h3>The Living Tar</h3>
<hr><br>
The Living Tar is a substance full of deadly complexities. &nbsp;Within
the oozing pitch of the tar, you will find two dangerous lifeforms to
be dealt with: tar babies and tar mothers.
<p>The tar can only be penetrated at flat areas around
its perimeter. &nbsp;Corners withstand sword punctures. &nbsp;It is
possible to carve some tar into a shape that cannot be reduced any
further because there are no exposed flat areas to strike. &nbsp;The
four squares of tar below are an example of this:</p>

<p>When tar is stabilized it poses no threat at all and
can be left alone. &nbsp;But when Beethro cuts through the tar with his
sword, it reshapes itself dynamically and tar babies may spring from
the new formation. &nbsp;It is difficult to explain the rules for tar
reshaping in words, but if removing a square of tar by hitting it with
the sword causes adjacent tar areas to be only one square wide or high,
those affected squares will change to tar babies.</p>
<p>Tar babies will attack on the turn following their
formation and in the same manner as dungeon roaches. &nbsp;They are the
only element of the Living Tar that can destroy Beethro, though he may
become trapped by growing tar.</p>
<p>If a tar mother is present in the room, the tar will
grow outward every thirty turns. &nbsp;The only way to stop this growth
and stabilize the tar is to destroy the tar mother by carving a path
through the tar to her. &nbsp;The expanding tar may create tar babies
as it tries to fill crevices less than two squares wide.</p>
<p>If there is more than one tar mother in a room, all
tar mothers must be destroyed to stop the tar from growing.</p>
