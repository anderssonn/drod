<h3>Goblins</h3>
<hr>
The goblins used to fashion tourist trinkets to sell to explorers, but
have lately found that it is easier to just kill them and take their
possessions. &nbsp;These devious creatures have a healthy fear of a
sharp blade, and unlike other dungeon creatures won't rush Beethro if
his sword is wielded in their direction.
<p>Despite being relatively intelligent, the goblin has
a difficult time finding his way around complex obstacles to get to his
prey.</p>
